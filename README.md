# UnderGradSolidState
Last year I got the chance grading the undegrad solid state physics at the University of Chicago. When preparing the solutions to the homeworks I realized that students might get more feelings if the some of the statements could be visualized. In particular, there's a fair amount of random knowledge most students (after taking undergrad quantum mechanics) did not master. In this repo I collected and uploaded some plots I prepared for the course.


### Density of States of simple tight-binding model

### Effective mass of Kronig-Penney model
The Kronig-Penney model is a single-particle quantum mechanical problem that gives rise to the band structure. In a word, it describes a single quantum particle running in a periodic potential profile. Usually the potential is modeled by an array of Dirac delta function. Details can be found in the following Wiki page.

To solve the energy, very often we have to solve a transcendental equation. In this case it's the following
