# UnderGradSolidState
Last year I got the chance grading the undegrad solid state physics at the University of Chicago. When preparing the solutions to the homeworks I realized that students might get more feelings if the some of the statements could be visualized. In particular, there's a fair amount of random knowledge most students (after taking undergrad quantum mechanics) did not master. In this repo I collected and uploaded some plots I prepared for the course.


### Density of States of simple tight-binding model

### Effective mass of Kronig-Penney model

### Chern number of Qi-Wu-Zhang model
